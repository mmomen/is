# is

A social media site based on statuses.
Attempting to change conversations from 'what' to 'how'.

Connect with your close friends and know what they're up to at the moment.
Statuses can be simply as "eating, brb, driving". 


Current features:

1. Connect with friends by searching their email. 
2. Post a status (statuses are never saved and are just a representation of the moment). 
3. Change your friend's name (default is their email. but if you want to refer to them by a different name,
simply double click on their name and change it!)
