# is

is, a social media site based on statuses.
Attempting to change conversations from 'what' to 'how'.

Connect with your close friends and know what they're up to at the moment.
Statuses can be simply as "eating", "brb", "driving" or something much more special like "at Disney World", and "watching the NBA Finals at John's". 
No longer text your close friends, "what are you up to?". Instead ask them, "how is Disney World?" or "why does work suck today?"


Current features:

1. Connect with friends by searching their email. 
2. Post a status (statuses are never saved and are just a representation of the moment). 
3. Change your friend's name (default is their email but if you want to refer to them by a different name,
simply double click on their name and change it!)
4. Rearrange the order of your friends by turning on click and drag. 

Upcoming features:
1. photo statuses with caption (mid March). 
2.
